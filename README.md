I am working as ***Support Service*** in the **software company focusing on _TMS solution_**.
I learn git out of my interest as my company use git for CI/CD and I use it a little bit for a configuration on certain module.

I love deep fried and salad.
> I love to try anything new for both cuisine and leaning.
